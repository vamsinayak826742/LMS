### **Library Management System (React.js Frontend) - Project Overview**  

#### **Project Description:**  
The **Library Management System** is a web application developed using **React.js**, designed to allow **admins to manage library members and books dynamically without backend integration**. The system enables **adding new members**, **managing member logins**, and **adding books to be visible for all users** using **React state management**.

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Member Management:**  
  - Admins can **add new members** with details like name, admission ID, email, phone number, and password.  
  - The newly added members are immediately **visible in the Get Members section**.  
  - The system simulates login details for members using local state.  

- **Book Management:**  
  - Admins can **add new books** with details such as book name, author, language, and category.  
  - The books added are instantly **visible to all users**.  
  - Uses **React state management** to dynamically update and display books.  

- **Dynamic Data Handling:**  
  - React **useState and useEffect hooks** are used to store and update members and books dynamically.  
  - No database or backend is requiredâ€”**all data is managed within React**.  
  - Simulated **dropdown selection and real-time updates** allow seamless user experience.  

#### **Technologies Used:**  
- **React.js** (for component-based UI development)  
- **Semantic UI** (for styling dropdowns and UI elements)  
- **React Hooks** (**useState, useEffect** for managing local state)  
- **CSS & Flexbox** (for responsive design)  

#### **Role & Contributions:**  
- Developed a **state-driven dynamic UI** using React.js.  
- Implemented **member and book management** functionalities.  
- Designed **interactive dropdowns and forms** for better user experience.  
- Ensured **instant visibility of added members and books** without backend dependencies.  

#### **Outcome:**  
This project demonstrates my ability to build **fully functional frontend applications** with **dynamic state management** in React.js. It showcases **efficient UI handling, state updates, and data rendering** without requiring an external database or API integration.
